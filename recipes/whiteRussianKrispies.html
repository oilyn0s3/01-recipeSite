        <h3><strong>The Science Behind It 🌟</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Dehydration. Dehydration is the process of drawing moisture (water) out of food 
            in an effort to preserve or dry up its surface, according to 
            Molecular Gastronomy: Exploring the Science of Flavor by Herve This. 
            Traditionally, this technique been used primarily for preserving a surplus of foods 
            like herbs or for more convenient snacking (like dried fruit). In molecular gastronomy, 
            however, dehydration is also used to create crunchy textures, flavor powders or preserve the crispiness (and flavors) of 
            foods like Kahlua-infused Rice Krispies. Dehydration can be performed using a dehydrator 
            or a common household oven, provided that the oven can be set to temperatures below 200 degrees Fahrenheit.  
        </p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients 🥫</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup of half and half</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of Kahlua liquor</li>
                <li>1/8 cup of Rice Krispies cereal</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. of sugar </li>
                <li>1/4 cup of vodka</li>
            </ul>            
            
        <h3><strong>How to Make It 🤔</strong></h3>
        <p> 
            You’ll want to make the Kahlua-infused Krispies ahead of time for this crunchy cocktail. 
            Toss the cereal with 1/4 cup of the Kahlua liquor in order to coat, then in a dehydrator (or an oven on its lowest setting), 
            dehydrate the Kahlua-coated cereal for one hour. 
            Repeat the aforementioned step for another coat of Kahlua. Depending on your dehydrator 
            or oven you may need to leave the cereal in it overnight to complete the drying/crisping process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have the cereal infused with the Kahlua, you can move on to the “milk” part. 
            Combine ice, vodka and sugar in a cocktail shaker and shake until the sugar has dissolved. 
            Strain the vodka/sugar and pour and stir it into the half and half. 
            When ready to serve, pour Kahlua Krispies into a bowl and add half and half/vodka/sugar mixture. Stir to combine.
