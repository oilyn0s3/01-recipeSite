        <h3><strong>The Science Behind It 🌟</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Maltodextrin. Maltodextrin is a subtly sweet simple sugar known as a polysaccharide. 
            It is derived from the break down of starch, corn, wheat, tapioca or potatoes. Generally if you’re cooking with it, you’re using the tapioca kind. 
            As Modernist Cooking Made Easy points out, due to its unique ability to absorb oils and fats, 
            maltodextrin is best used as thickening agent in foods or a method of powdering high-fat foods. 
            This food additive is also used to preserve and intensify flavors in foods and as a low-calorie sweetener substitute.
