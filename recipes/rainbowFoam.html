        <h3><strong>The Science Behind It ðŸŒŸ</strong></h3>
        <p>
            Gelatin. Gelatin is used to thicken and turn liquid foods into a solid gummy gel. 
            Unlike the plant-based agar-agar, Gelatin is derived from collagen found in the skin and bones of animals, 
            most notably from pigs, as MCME points out.A gelatin-based foam, like the Rainbow Foam below, 
            is created when partially set gelatin is agitated, usually with a whisk, to incorporate air 
            and bubbles into the gelatin mixture which is then trapped once the gelatin cools, 
            much like how water is trapped in the standard formation of Jello. 
            The trapped air results in a light and airy texture.   

        </p>

        <h3><strong>Ingredients ðŸ¥«</strong></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6 boxes of Jello, each a different color</li>
                <li>1 cup boiling water for each pack of jello</li>
                <li>1 and 3/4 cups cold water for each pack of jello</li>
            </ul>            
            
        <h3><strong>How to Make It ðŸ¤”</strong></h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix each flavor of Jello separately and according to instructions on the box.</li>
            <li>But use a 1/4 cup less water than is called for on the package.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate each jello mixture for several hours or until just before it has completely set.</li>
            <li>Donâ€™t let it completely set.</li>
            <li>Then dump each jello into a separate bowl and with an electric whisk, whisk each jello until frothy.</li>
            <li>Spoon the first jello color into each glass and refrigerate for 30 minutes or until it sets.</li>
            <li>Then repeat this process with the other five colors, layering them on top of each other.</li>
            <li>Then allow entire Rainbow Foam to sit in fridge overnight to set.</li>
            <li>Top with whipped cream if youâ€™d like.</li>
        </ol>
