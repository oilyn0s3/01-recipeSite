        <h3>A very nice collection of tasty recipes filled with science and *ahem* Chemicals! 😍 </h3>
        <p>
            It’s time to play with your food again. Except this time around, as an adult, you actually have access to the
            chemicals and tools you’ll need to create some really awesome culinary special effects. And it’s all because of
            <em>molecular gastronomy</em>.

            Molecular gastronomy is a branch of food science that utilizes the principles of <strong>chemistry, physics and biology</strong>
            to develop delicious food that can be presented in new and interesting ways—solid cocktails, fruit jelly caviar,
            or vegetable foams and bubbles. It’s basically the science of food you thought could only exist in Willy Wonka’s
            chocolate factory 😋.

            But with a grasp on some of the basic concepts of molecular gastronomy, you’re actually much closer to those
            fantasy recipes than you think 🤫.
